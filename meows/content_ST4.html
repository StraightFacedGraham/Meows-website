        <h2>Teacher Quality and Professional Development</h2>
        <p>The quality of teachers and their development as teachers are imperative to improving the quality of education as having more professional and experienced teachers will greatly improve the quality of learning for students. Due to this, the government have introduced a number of reforms, such as the Early Career Framework (ECF), which are designed to improve the recruitment and retention of teachers, while also providing them with additional opportunities which will allow them to develop in their careers. However, teachers have still expressed a desire for more follow-up support and more time to develop themselves as teachers, and there is still a need for improvement in training teachers in areas such as teaching students with special educational needs and disabilities.</p>

        <h2>Eliminating Discrimination in Education</h2>
        <p>To achieve quality education, the inclusion of all individuals is required, regardless of race, gender, or disability. To achieve this, discrimination in education should be eliminated, as discrimination within an educational environment may hinder the growth of targeted individuals and prevent the development of a thriving educational environment, where all the students will be able to learn better. In order to achieve this goal, it should be ensured that all individuals would have equal access to educational opportunities, and schools should foster an inclusive learning environment where students would feel safe and respected so that they may thrive academically within this space. Exposing students to a diversity of cultures would grant students insight to a variety of different perspectives and allow them to tolerate cultures or viewpoints which may differ from their own within a diverse society.</p>

    <section id="GainingSkillsForFinancialSuccess">
        <h2>Gaining Skills for Financial Success</h2>
        <p>Quality education requires students to gain skills, including technical and vocational skills, which will improve their career prospects and allow them to succeed in their chosen careers. To achieve this, the curriculum should be well designed and relevant to the ever-changing needs of society and should allow students to gain a broader understanding of different subjects, allowing them to associate themselves with their interests once they have graduated as students and are looking to pursue a career. The content taught should be engaging and meaningful to the students, and teachers who are able to employ a variety of teaching methods will be able to better engage students within the material, adding to the importance of improving the quality of teachers and their training.</p>

    <section id="ContinuousImprovement">
        <h2>Continuous Improvement</h2>
        <p>In education, there is a constant process of identifying areas where improvements can be made, and through implementing these improvements and assessing their impacts, positive progress within improving the quality of education can be made. This is best shown through the Total Quality Management framework (TQM), which is a system which dictates that quality is achieved through continually improving an organization's processes and members, and this can be applied to education to achieve quality education. This can be achieved by providing teachers with the necessary tools which they need to develop themselves, and by school management fostering an environment where positive developments are encouraged. Overall, this method focuses on making incremental improvements through each small step, however through consistent improvements and growth in the system, quality education is achieved.</p>
